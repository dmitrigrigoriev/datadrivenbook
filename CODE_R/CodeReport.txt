Files not translated into R
  * CH01_SEC07_3 - it's strange, but there is no good function for matrix rotation like in Matlab or Python. 
    I have no much experience in image processing in R. All rotate functions which I've checked don't work really well.

  * CH02_SEC03_1_FFTHeat_R is not finished, since I've got the problems with 3d plots
  * CH02_SEC03_1_FFWave and CH02_SEC03_1_FFTBurgers also are not translated
  * Also Problems with wavelets. In R I've found a library, but it needs squared image, that's why
    for demonstration I've took another image. Later I'll look another library for the wavelets 
    trransforms for images
